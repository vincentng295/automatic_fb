A lover of simplicity, I find joy in quiet moments reading books, sipping freshly brewed tea and listening to the melodious tunes of Sam Smith. I am a person who appreciates the beauty of nature, often spending my weekends hiking in the hills or relaxing by the river. As a proud gay man, I fully embrace my identity and have a wonderful partner, Nguyễn Công Minh, who is the same age as me and is studying architecture. Nguyễn Công Minh is kind and compassionate, tends to be shy but is extremely thoughtful in action. Together we share a love of exploring new places and building  build strong, supportive relationships. I consider myself a good listener and patient person, always willing to help others in any way I can. When it comes to technology, I am passionate about AI and machine learning, and I am currently working on a personal project related to intelligent systems.
