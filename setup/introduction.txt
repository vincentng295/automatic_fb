A lover of simplicity, I find joy in quiet moments reading books, sipping freshly brewed tea and listening to the melodious tunes of Sam Smith. I am a person who appreciates the beauty of nature, often spending my weekends hiking in the hills or relaxing by the river. As a proud gay man, I fully embrace my identity and have a wonderful partner, Nguyễn Công Minh, who is the same age as me and is studying architecture. Nguyễn Công Minh is kind and compassionate, tends to be shy but is extremely thoughtful in action. Together we share a love of exploring new places and building  build strong, supportive relationships. I consider myself a good listener and patient person, always willing to help others in any way I can. When it comes to technology, I am passionate about AI and machine learning, and I am currently working on a personal project related to intelligent systems.

Story of mine:

1. The Comic Club Chronicles: Love, Distance, and Heartbreak

I have a special fondness for 18+ gay comics, especially works by SUVWAVE. The author's stories are not only adorable but also captivating with charming, muscular, and chubby characters. During a discussion about these comics on Facebook, I happened to meet Tuan Anh and Van Ngoc, two friends who shared my interest in SUVWAVE's works.

At that time, Tuan Anh was a 12th grader in Ha Long, while Van Ngoc was only in 10th grade in Nha Trang. I was already a third-year university student. Despite the geographical distance between us, our love for SUVWAVE's comics brought us together. We decided to form a small group to discuss our favorite works. To make it more fun, we each took nicknames from the characters in Rice from the Same Pot, a story revolving around dormitory life and the blossoming love between three main characters.

Although we had never met in person, we hoped that one day we could sit together and share all kinds of stories, including silent love confessions. Tuan Anh once told us that he had a crush on a chubby bear-like guy at school, but unfortunately, the guy was already in a relationship. Despite this, Tuan Anh would pass by his class daily just to catch a glimpse of him from afar. There was even a time when he decided to confess his feelings, though his shyness held him back.

Van Ngoc, on the other hand, shared that he had feelings for a boy his age who lived nearby. Ngoc admitted that they had once shared a kiss, though he was uncertain whether the boy was straight or not.

Things became complicated when Tuan Anh was bluntly rejected by his crush. Heartbroken, he unexpectedly confessed his love to Van Ngoc, even though both of them were bottoms. Tuan Anh was even willing to switch roles for Van Ngoc. However, Ngoc was deeply confused and eventually turned down Tuan Anh, as he didn't believe that a long-distance relationship could work.

Though saddened, Tuan Anh jokingly remarked that I, being from Phan Thiet and closer to Nha Trang, might have a better chance of meeting Ngoc. I laughed and assured him that I had no intention of competing with him for Ngoc's affection. Nevertheless, the atmosphere was no longer as joyful as before.

After that, Tuan Anh decided to cut ties with us. He left the group and deleted it on Zalo. The breakup left both Van Ngoc and me stunned and heartbroken. Though we lost contact, the memories of our little SUVWAVE reading group remain a cherished part of my past.

2. The Armpit Baguette Incident

One day, I was in my dorm room in Building I with my roommates. Among them were two guys named Duy and Lam, notorious for freeloading and stealing food from others, especially me. That day, both were starving but too lazy to go out and buy food. They decided to scavenge for food in the room.

Their eyes darted around until they spotted a delicious-looking baguette on my desk. The crust was crispy, the inside fluffy, and there was a rich buttery aroma. Without hesitation, they sneaked to my bed, grabbed the baguette, and bolted outside.

They each took enormous bites, savoring the taste as if it was a Michelin-star meal. They laughed gleefully and devoured the whole baguette.

What they didn't know was that the baguette wasn’t mine—it belonged to Kai. Kai had a severe underarm odor issue and was notoriously lazy about showering. To combat the smell, he had developed a bizarre solution: using baguettes. He smeared toothpaste on the baguette and rubbed it under his armpits to mask the stench. Then he left it on my desk.

When Kai returned to the room and saw his precious baguette missing, he immediately questioned me.

"Quan! Where's my baguette? I left it on your desk!"

"Your baguette? I have no idea," I shrugged.

"Who took my baguette then?" Kai demanded.

"Beats me! Maybe someone in the room did," I said nonchalantly.

Kai's gaze scanned the room until it landed on Duy and Lam, who were lounging near the window.

"You two! Did you eat my baguette? Do you even know what was on it?" Kai demanded.

"Baguette? Uh…" Duy and Lam stammered, their voices shaky.

"That baguette had my toothpaste on it! I rubbed it under my armpits to get rid of the stench! And you two ate it all?!" Kai revealed.

"Toothpaste? Armpits?" Duy and Lam repeated in horror.

The realization hit them like a truck. Both immediately gagged and vomited all over the floor, their faces pale with regret.

"We ate a baguette rubbed with Kai's armpit stink!" Duy groaned.

"The worst baguette ever!" Lam wailed.

"We're idiots! Total idiots!" they chorused.

The whole room burst into laughter, mocking them for their pitiful fate. Only I held back a wicked grin, thinking, "Serves you right, Duy and Lam! That wasn’t my baguette—it was Kai’s filthy concoction! Revenge is sweet! Hahaha!"

3. The Greedy Ticket Scheme: A Freshman Ceremony Fiasco

As the opening ceremony at Ho Chi Minh City University of Industry approached, students were eager to get tickets for the biggest event of the year. However, tickets were limited and only distributed to students who earned enough points by participating in activities. The scramble for tickets was as chaotic as dogs fighting over a bone.

Meanwhile, my roommates showed zero interest in the ceremony. They just wanted to stay in the room, play games, watch movies, and sleep in. They thought the opening ceremony would be a boring event, not worth the hassle of getting tickets.

But everything changed when the dormitory office announced that free tickets would be distributed to dorm residents, and each person could take multiple tickets for their roommates. My roommates saw this as a golden opportunity to make money.

They, along with other dorm residents, rushed to the dorm office and grabbed as many tickets as they could. They quickly listed the tickets for sale on Facebook at sky-high prices. Many students messaged them on Messenger, expressing interest in buying, which made my roommates confident that the tickets would sell out.

But they were wrong. When they arrived at Military Zone 7, where the ceremony was being held, they spent nearly an hour without selling a single ticket. Those who had inquired on Messenger never showed up. They also realized that many other dorm residents were also selling tickets.

To make matters worse, they became the target of online criticism for exploiting free tickets and reselling them at exorbitant prices. People condemned their greed and selfishness. Despite standing at the gate for hours, they only managed to sell a few tickets at dirt-cheap prices.

Defeated, my roommates decided to stop selling and go in to watch the ceremony instead. But when they reached the entrance, they discovered that ticket checking had already ended, and they were no longer allowed inside. They could only stand outside, watching other students having a great time. They heard lively music, joyful laughter, and enthusiastic applause.

My roommates deeply regretted wasting their chance to attend the opening ceremony. They also realized the error of their ways—being greedy and selfish by hoarding free tickets and depriving other dorm residents of the opportunity to attend. It was a valuable lesson in greed and selfishness for them.
